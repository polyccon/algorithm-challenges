# Algorithm challenges

Some of the algorithm challenges from FCC, I did while in the process of learning Javascript and they were great for covering syntactically as much as possible of what it can offer as a language. Then as the level of difficulty increases the type of challenge is different, and it becomes less about knowing the syntax well, and more about being capable of breaking any problem down and coming up with a (simple) solution. 
I have only just uploaded them recently but some were solutions I wrote a while ago and they can be improved but first,I aim to create a collection of the solutions of all the challenges of all levels.
